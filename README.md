An old game for an old (Now long defunct) game collaboration company

My original plan for this game was for it to be a Super Smash Bros. styled game featuring the main members of "Team PHE" (which stands for Pikakid98 Studios, Hand In The Cookie Jar Productions (Now Not-So Classic Games) and EyeShellGames) with additional characters being cameos from either existing Team PHE games, future games or even scrapped games. However this game never got past the super basic prototype and only exists now as an archive.
